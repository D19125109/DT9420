    "## Introduction\n",
    "I have decided to pursue further studies in GIS as mapping has always been a field I have been interested in. I studied Civil Engineering as an Undergrad in UL, where the surveying and computer modelling topics were the ones that interested me the most. I joined the Defence Forces after graduating, where I now serve as a Captain in the Army Corps of Engineers. I never had many opportunities to study programming or computing, but it is a field I would like to broaden my knowledge in. My hope is that I can take what I have learned here and use it to create GIS based solutions for the specific challeneges faced by members of the Corps of Engineers\n",

    "## Overiview of Python\n",
    "Python is one of the world's most popular programming languages. It has many features that have led to its popularity, but some of the most important ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) It's easy to learn and use\n",
    "This is down to the fact that it's a high level programming language and is more expressive and easier to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It's and interpreted language\n",
    "This means that the interpreted executes the code line by line at a time, making it suitable for beginners and allows for simpler debuggin\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It's cross platform and open source\n",
    "Python works on Linux, Mac and PC, and can be easily used across all operating systems. It's also free to download and has a really active online community where people can share code with each other (source: javapoint.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has however faced difficulties as a programming language. While the fact that it is an interpreted language makes it much easier to learn and use, this also makes it much slower than lower level languages like C++. It also isn't really suitable for mobile development. It's also not really suitable for large databases, as it isn't most secure language (source: www.geeksforgeeks.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of todays online applications are built with Python. Some of the most notable examples are:\n",
    "-Spotify\n",
    "-Netflix\n",
    "-Instagram\n",
    "\n",
    "(source: www.netguru.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also the prefered language to be used with most GIS applications. According to www.gislounge.com,\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Python has not only been utilized within commercial GIS such as products by Esri but also open source platforms, including as part of QGIS and GRASS. In fact, Python today is by far the most widely used language by GIS users and programmers. Large companies such as Esri have embraced Python because it is a relatively easy language that many users have fully accepted.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main types of data used in GIS tasks are vector data, and raster data. Vector data relates to points in space with an x and a y co-ordinate, sometimes a z co-ordinate if height also needs to be taken into account. These can be joined together to make lines, polygons and areas. Raster data refers to dividing a field into small pixels, and giving each one an attribute based on it's location in the grid (source: www.gitta.info)\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming offers significant advantages to GIS users. Firstly, it makes GIS tasks much easier, as it's only necessary to write a script once, make sure it works and then automate the task. Secondly, it makes completing the task much quicker, as the computer will be able to complete the task much quicker than the user pointing and clicking. Lastly, it will be much more accurate, as there is no scope for variations that could occur in accuracy due to the user inputting repetitive data over time. An example I discovered was from a Environmental Scientist working in Yellowstone National Park that was studying the paths of predators through the park. He automated the process using statistical methods to create random animal track patterns and a sampling scheme, and then calculating the number of intersections to see how the population might vary over time (http://millermountain.com/geospatialblog/2017/05/15/coding-for-gis-professionals/)"
